## Installation

### 1. Fork or Clone the Repository
You can either fork the repository to your GitHub account or clone it directly to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdesharaBrijesh/HealthAlly.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required Python dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. MongoDB Configuration
Create a `config.py` file in the root directory of the project to securely store your MongoDB connection URL. The `config.py` file should look like this:
```python
# config.py
MONGO_URI = "your_mongodb_connection_url"
```
Replace `"your_mongodb_connection_url"` with your actual MongoDB connection URL. You can find this in your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

**Important**: Ensure the `config.py` file is NOT pushed to GitHub. It should be listed in the `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information from being exposed.

### 4. Running the Application
